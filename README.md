<h1>I've been learning frontend technologies.</h1>
<p>I'm passionate about web development and have been focusing on frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Three months ago, I began learning HTML and have since been continuously expanding my knowledge. To further develop my skills, I recently decided to create a replica of certain components of a popular mobile company's website.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
